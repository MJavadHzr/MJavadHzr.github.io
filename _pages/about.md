Hi ðŸ‘‹. I'm Javad. I'm a 4th-year B.S. student studying Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu), Iran. What truly captivates me is the world of machine learning, especially the intricate domain of deep neural networks. Right now, I'm focused on the cool areas in machine learning such as `adversarial machine learning`, `federated learning`, and `computer vision`. I firmly believe that by unraveling the secrets of deep networks and their adversarial properties, we can bring machines closer to the level of human cognition. This journey towards enhancing the performance and reliability of artificial intelligence systems is my driving force.

Thank you for visiting my academic webpage, where I'll be sharing my research findings, projects, and insights on the fascinating world of computer engineering and machine learning. Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you share similar interests or have any questions.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
